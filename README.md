# Dotfiles

This repo is forked from the excellent work by the github user Parth.  Here is a walkthrough of his work.

## Basic runtime opperations 

All default dotfiles (`.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, etc) source something within the dotfiles repository. This helps separate changes that are synced across all your machines with system specific changes.

Upon launching a new shell, the first thing that's evaulated is `zshrc_manager.sh`. This script first launches tmux. Then once zsh logs in, within tmux, it updates the dotfiles repository, and sources the changes.

## [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

* `cd` has been reassigned to `cd` and `ls`. Every time you navigate to a new directory, it will display the contents of that directory.

### Prompt

The prompt takes on the form:

```
[plugin, plugin, ...]: 
```

Each plugin is sensitive to where you are and what you're doing, they reveal themselves when it's contextually relevant. Plugins include:

* `PWD plugin`: always present, tells you where you are. Always the first plugin.
* `Status code plugin`: appears anytime a program returns with a non-zero status code. Tells you what status code the program completed with. 
* `Git plugin`: appears when you're in a git repository. Tells you what branch you're on, and how many files have been changed since the last commit.
* `Sudo plugin`: tells you when you can sudo without a password. Or when you're logged in as root.
* `Time plugin`: appears when a program took more than 1s to execute. Tells you how long it took to execute.
* `PID plugin`: appears when you background a task. Tells you what the PID of the task is.

### Keybindings
| Key Stroke | What It Does |
